        Welcome to this joke website I had to make for my CSCI 4018 class. This website features some of my favorite jokes made. The jokes featured on this page are some programming jokes.
        I hope you get a laugh out of them as much as I did even if they are kind of dad jokes. However even if you don't you can always find more jokes to laugh at.
